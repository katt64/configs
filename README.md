## Screenshot description
The screenshot is my battlestation screnshotted from userland (not from the
screen) using `screenfetch -s`. The operating supervisor is Gentoo, configured
from scratch, running on a native system (not under any kind of hypervisor).

The following are the windows I have running and what they are doing (top-down,
left-right order):

- *xdvik* (app-text/xdvik-22.87.03) &mdash; showing a large facetious message.
  :p
- *vim* (app-editors/vim-8.0.0386) &mdash; editing an Nroff source file for the
  facetious message.
- *htop* (sys-process/htop-2.0.2) &mdash; showing how selfish Firefox can be.
- *glxgears* (x11-apps/mesa-progs) &mdash; Hmm&hellip; I don't know what it's
  showing&hellip; Do you? ;p
- *ranger* (app-misc/ranger) &mdash; browsing some files pertaining to PARI/GP's
  compilation process
- *screenfetch* (app-misc/screenfetch) &mdash; Captures the screen at the
  instance *you* can see now.

A few subtleties include:

- [The wallpaper in the
  background](https://vsco.co/katt64/media/59e8cd0855f6ec424cf50516). It's about
  a trivial problem, really. :p
- The VPN provider I'm using provides me with IPv6!!! <3
- I'm running this battlestation on one laptop connected to an external
  keyboard, wireless mouse, HDMI monitor, and occasionally an external floppy
  disk drive to retrieve legacy data. :3

## This!
This repository intends to openly and freely share with the public domain (you
and everyone) an idea of a *minimal, but very useful* configuration that I'm
using everyday on my setup (c.f. previous section), and also give me a nice
repository to store my configuration files that I've worked my blood and sweat
on **literally**!

So, there you go. Browse away, it's here for ya. You may modify it to fit your
needs.

## Any strings attached?
*Long answer short: no. Are you human, though?*

I don't assume any rights on any of my configuration work present in this
repository. However, if any files in here are protected by someone else's
copyright (this happens with software written by other people), then that
entity's copyright rules apply, but I just won't mention it because I don't know
much about laws 'n shit. (I'm a rebel!) :p

So, You can use my configuration files however you want. It's literally just
free, not strings attached, but just be mindful of other people's
already-imposed copyright that we might not know about. You **need not** credit
me when using my configurations from here, but if you want to, of course, you
can! :) Just don't let creditting work bother you; life is too short to be
bothered by other people's shit.

Oh, one slight caveat I'd like to point out is that, I really urge that you be
mindful and very polite when commenting or reporting "issues" in my
configurations. Don't roast, troll, negatively criticize me, or hurt my
feelings; that's happened before and it's just not cool. If you have "issues"
with my configurations, it means you have issues with my preferences; my
preferences are mine, and if it bothers you, it's your problem! Right? Let's be
honest about that. So, just &hellip; **be human, be nice**.

Of course, I'd like to hear suggestions if it's easy for me to digest and use in
my everyday life. The general rule is just that: if you are greater than 50%
certain that what you're about to say to me will not make me a better person,
but will in fact make me much worse off, don't say it.

### "But &hellip; Your setup is lame!"
*So, you really wanna break my heart, huh? Haha. It's okey. :p*

I mean, seriously, I know that other guys' setups are much more sophisticated
and powerful than mine, but this really is the best I can come up with, it is
simple, and it fucking works! I've never been happier in my life with my setup.
So, what more can I ask?!

This setup works for me just fine. I'm just putting it here to see to it that it
works for you too, perhaps even better than it does me. I'm using it everyday
and I'm even earning money from it. I've got a few freelance jobs as a web
developer (haha, as if I'm so good at it) and I'm using Nroff to typeset
worksheets and exercises for my mom's students at a school she works. :p

If you are just here to say that my setup is lame, then you'd better scram,
boii; but if you wanna make a few constructive suggestions that might make my
life easier, then shoot! I'm quite a busy person. I spend most of my days trying
to be productive and studying for high school even though I seem to be behind
everyone no matter what I do. I still cannot fathom how most people can spend so
much time having the best of all UNIX setups and yet seem to live out life so
fine. So, understand that.
