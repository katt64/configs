# *configs://home/katt* &mdash; Configuration files in my home directory
Obviously, there are mostly dot-files or configuration files in my directory.

Please note that the following files are the same for both katt's home
(configs://home/katt/) directory and root's home /root/) directory:

- *.vimrc* &mdash; Vim's local configuration file.
- *.vim/* &mdash; Vim's misc. directory.
- *.zshrc* &mdash; zshell's configuration (based on [grml's
  configuration](https://grml.org/zsh/)).

Some of the files may have been editted on their way to `/root/` for
security reasons. Since the files in `/root/` are almost identical to the ones
in `/home/katt/`, I found it wise to just not included `/root/` in this
repository otherwise they would just be redundant.

VSCO. Filter: M5.

## An example of strings being attached
In this directory, files that have been copyrighted and licensed by their
respective authors include but are not limited to:

- *.zshrc* (c) grml-team (grml.org), licensed under >=(GPL v2).

This is an example where the license should be respected, even though the
default case for all files in this repository is to be completely open and free
as described in configs://README.md. So, do the right thing, alright? ;)
